 		<h2 >About</h2>
 		<p >An art gallery is a room or a building in which visual art is displayed. Among the reasons art may be displayed are aesthetic enjoyment, cultural enrichment, or for marketing purposes. While "gallery" continues to be used in the name of institutions for the study, preservation, and restoration as well as the display of art, these additional functions identify the institution as an Art museum. Most art galleries open to the public are commercial enterprises for the sale of artwork, others may be part of art cooperatives or non-profit organizations. As part of the art world, art galleries play an important role in maintaining the network of connections that define fine art.

			<p>The theme of the week is about Natural calamity.Storms, earthquakes and
volcanoes are common in the biblical and mythological stories that inspiredmuch art in earlier centuries and natural disasters allowed artists to show off
their ability to affect the viewer.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some artists specialised in
painting storms and wrecked ships. When all trade and much travel depended
on the sea, such subjects were especially meaningful. In the Romantic era, a
storm was a desirable emotional experience and such subjects became
increasingly popular: many of Turnerâ€™s most dramatic landscapes are of
storms. Mount Vesuvius was a popular subject for artists and tourists on the
Grand Tour, though destructive eruptions were fortunately rare; the
devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755, for example, seems almost
unrecorded.</p>
